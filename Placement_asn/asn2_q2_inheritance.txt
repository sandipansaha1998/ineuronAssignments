#When a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance.

#case 1 : Base classes have overridden methods

class Base1:
    def fnc(self):
        print("BASE1")
class Base2:
    def fnc(self):
        print("BASE2")
class Child(Base1,Base2):
        pass

obj = Child()
obj.fnc()


This gives the output as :
BASE1
Since the base class BASE1 is before class BASE2 in the parameter list of the child class.

# Case 2 :

class Base1:
    def fnc(self):
        print("BASE1")
class Base2:
    def fnc(self):
        print("BASE2")
class Child(Base1,Base2):
    def fnc(self):
        print("Child")
obj = Child()
obj.fnc()
Base1.fnc(obj)
Base2.fnc(obj)



This gives the output as : all the classes have same function
Child
BASE1
BASE2
